## Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personalized Neovim configuration.
I find myself using JetBrains Webstorm for many projects, and I'd like to
check Vim as a VS Code alternative.

## Motivation

The reasons why I want to get into Neovim is more or less the same reason
why I use Arch Linux for desktop usage:

- Is minimal by default
- I get to choose what to install and what not to

The Vim keybinds and the keyboard-first workflow is a great bonus!


## Dependencies
- ripgrep (for file search)
- fd (for file listing)
